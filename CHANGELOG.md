## [0.2.1] - 2025-01-21 - User Journey Improvements Implemented

### Improvements Completed (2025-01-21)

#### API Key Management
- Added comprehensive API key setup helper with provider-specific instructions
- Implemented connection testing with real-time feedback
- Added visual status indicators for API connectivity
- Included direct links to API key generation pages

#### Export Functionality
- Implemented JSON export with metadata and timestamps
- Added CSV export for cluster data with proper escaping
- Created HTML report generation with formatted output
- All export functions now fully operational

#### Configuration Presets
- Added three preset modes: Quick (5min), Standard (15min), Deep (30+min)
- Each preset optimizes model selection, batch size, and processing depth
- Visual feedback shows selected preset
- Settings automatically adjust based on preset choice

#### WebSocket Integration
- WebSocket handler already implemented in backend
- Client-side connection code functional
- Real-time progress updates ready for use

### Previous State Assessment

#### Functional Components
- Web server running successfully on port 8080
- File upload API endpoint (`/api/upload`) processing JSON files
- Example data generation (`/api/example`) working
- Static file serving for HTML/CSS/JS assets
- Basic UI navigation between screens

#### Partially Functional
- **Analysis endpoint** - Requires complete config object (missing defaults)
- **Progress tracking** - UI exists but lacks WebSocket integration
- **File validation** - Upload works but missing real-time feedback
- **Results display** - Shows data but export functions not connected

#### Non-Functional
- **WebSocket/SSE** - No real-time updates during analysis
- **Clio features** - UI present but backend integration incomplete
- **Session persistence** - Cannot save/resume analysis sessions
- **Export functionality** - Buttons exist without implementation

### Critical User Journey Issues

1. **Onboarding Friction**
   - Users unclear on expected data format
   - No sample data preview or format documentation
   - Missing validation feedback

2. **Configuration Overwhelm**
   - All parameters exposed without context
   - No smart defaults based on data size
   - Missing presets for common use cases

3. **Analysis Black Box**
   - No progress updates during processing
   - Missing time estimates
   - No stage-by-stage feedback

4. **Results Confusion**
   - Overwhelming data presentation
   - No guided tour or key insights
   - Export options non-functional

### Improvement Roadmap

#### Immediate Fixes Required
1. Add default config values to `/api/analyze`
2. Implement WebSocket for real-time updates
3. Connect export functionality
4. Add comprehensive error handling

#### Next Phase Enhancements
1. Interactive onboarding with data preview
2. Config presets (Quick/Standard/Deep)
3. Real-time validation feedback
4. Results tour with key insights first
